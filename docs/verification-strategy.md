# Verification Strategy

PagerPilot verifies contracts at every boundary rather than relying on one successful screen recording.

## Static gates

- repository and submodule layout;
- environment-variable contracts;
- client credential exclusion;
- secret pattern scan;
- rollback identity alignment;
- remediation architecture contract;
- formatter, lint, and TypeScript.

## Unit and integration coverage

- specialist JSON validation;
- TrueForge SSE terminal-state handling and replay;
- agent pagination and bootstrap behavior;
- trusted proxy authorization;
- canonical persisted event ingestion;
- telemetry reducer phase precedence;
- durable reservation and state transitions;
- restart reconciliation and conflicts;
- Daytona result parsing and evidence invariants;
- Slack rendering and provider failures;
- Streamable HTTP and stdio MCP transports.

## Live proofs

Machine-readable evidence captures the saved agent, connector tools, four sibling threads, ask-user lifecycle, approval denial, native sandbox, Code Mode, large-response offload, SSE lifecycle, restart persistence, and atomic rollback flow. `pnpm evidence:capture` records each proof under `evidence/artifacts/` with SHA-256 metadata; a surface in `evidence/surface-matrix.json` is marked `verified` only after a proof is captured against the current `pagerpilot-incident-responder` saved agent.

## UI verification

The operator is checked at desktop, tablet, and mobile widths for horizontal overflow, scene hierarchy, and console/network errors. The command surface consumes the same event replay used after a browser refresh.
